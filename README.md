Play as various monsters!  
A work in progress.  

1) Download and put it in svencoop_addons, keeping directories
2) Add `map_script controlnpc/cnpc` to the map.cfg
3) uuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhh
4) Either add weapon_name to the map.cfg or `.player_give @me weapon_name` or any other way of giving stuff
5) Press the primary attack to turn into the monster
6) ????
7) PROFIT

The only way to revert to a normal player is to die :ayaya:
